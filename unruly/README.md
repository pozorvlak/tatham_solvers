This is a collection of experiments relating to some of the games in [Simon
Tatham's Portable Puzzle
Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/). You're
probably here because of my 2022 MathsJam Gathering talk, in which I sketch a
proof that Unruly is NP-complete. Code to generate the "untactical" puzzles I
generated for that talk can be found in the directory `unruly`, along with the
puzzles themselves.
